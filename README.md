It's 3 AM. An official phone alert wakes you up. It says "DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON". 
You have hundreds of notifications. Hundreds of random numbers are sending "It's a beautiful night tonight. Look outside.‚Äù
I turn on the TV.
"The aliens have turned the moon into their personal Earth survalence system. Anyone who looks at the moon will be abducted. A beam of will shoot down on earth and pull the person into a hovercraft loctated on our moon." Little do they know, my dream is so live with the aliens. (Looks at the moon)*A beam of light takes me into space*. In seconds im on the moon. Now we'll see what happens.
4th) I find my self in this dome like structure. The moon is filled with humans. Some panicking others in shock. I begin to interact with the aliens. I ask to lern about their tecnology and history and I become fansinated by the knowledge the aliens possess. 
5th) This fascination leads me to find the aliens source of power and knowledge. A device that can grant a person unlimited power. I then begin looking for this device and to my luck I find it laying in plain sight. I take the device for myself and a memory from the past comes to me. The anime Naruto. I then send everyone back to earth and use the aliens moon beam as the device to cast the infinite tsukuyomi. I put the whole world inside a perfect dream.
